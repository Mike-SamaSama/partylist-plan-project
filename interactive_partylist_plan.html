    <title>Interactive Party-List Registration Plan</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Stone and Emerald) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a single-page, vertical timeline. This structure was chosen because the source report is a sequential, multi-phase plan, and a timeline is the most intuitive way to visualize a roadmap. A sticky top navigation bar allows users to jump between the 5 phases. Each step in the timeline is an interactive card; users can click a "Show Details" button to toggle the visibility (accordion-style) of the "Deliverable" and "Legal Basis" for that step. This prevents information overload and encourages active exploration of the plan. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: 5-phase plan with steps, activities, deliverables, and legal basis.
        - Goal: Organize & Inform.
        - Viz/Presentation Method: An interactive vertical timeline built with HTML/Tailwind CSS. This is more engaging than the source's table structure.
        - Interaction: 1) Sticky nav with smooth scrolling. 2) Click-to-toggle details for each timeline step.
        - Justification: This design directly reflects the chronological flow of the source report and makes the dense, multi-part steps easy to digest one at a time.
        - Library/Method: Vanilla JS for DOM generation and interaction (toggling visibility). No charts needed as the data is qualitative.
        - CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used.
